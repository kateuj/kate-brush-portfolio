# Kate Brush Illustration Portfolio

This is my Milestone 1 project, which has been designed to showcase my own illustration work as an online portfolio.
To keep in concise, I have chosen a selection of my most recent work and displayed in a clear manner for prospective clients and collaborators to get a feel for my artistic style and contact me if desired. Due to alot of people using mobile devices more, especially on the go, I have used the 'mobile first' design technique and made sure the site is fully responsive.

# Planning & Development # 

### Business Strategy
As an illustrator, I have come to a stage where I would like to extend my professional presence online. My Instagram profile has gained some leads for work on occasion, but not at the level I would like it to be in an ideal situation.
<br>
I have wanted to create an Illustration portfolio site with the hope of gaining more clients and collaboration opportunities through people finding my site organically, but also for me to have an easier of demonstrating my abilities within interview settings - a link to a bright, colour, interactive website is far more eye-catching than a PDF portfolio that I have used in the past to show my work to prospective clients in the past.

### Target Audience

Predominently, my target audience will be prospective clients checking my style for suitability of their project, as well as potential collaborators and general visitors with an interest in illustration, that can in theory increase my exposure by sharing my site in their social media so increase my reach.

I collated some research on 'AdTargeting', where I can get an overview of what demographic search for certain key words. I found that the keyword 'illustration' is predominently searched by a female demographic (61%), within the 35-44 age range. Digging a bit deeper, I found that 'digital illustration' is again searched most by females (56%) within the 25-34 age range.

#### Digital Illustration Keyword Search
* 56% Female demographic
* 25-34 age range

This emphasised to me that my site needs to be fully responsive, as younger target audiences are more likely to view sites on their mobile. It has also inspired me from a design perspective, to keep the whole aesthetic bright and fun to be appealing to younger audiences, as well as potentially looking at a pastel colour palette to give an overall feminine feel to the site.

### User Needs

#### User Stories
1. Viewing my work to check suitability for a commission
2. Wishing to contact me for a collaboration
3. Wishing to contact me for a commission
3. Checking my portfolio for updates
4. Looking for inspiration for their own illustrative work
    
### Site Objectives

* To showcase my work in a bright and fun way to stand out from the crowd
* To build responsive site that works one mobile, tablet and desktop
* Give the user a positive experience
* Make the site clear and concise
* Easy to navigate around and find key information
* Aesthetically pleasing to demonstrate design skills
* A good site flow through carefully planned UI
* Provide the users with a way of contacting me
* To be accessible for screen readers

### Approach

* The information will be provided to the user logically and informed by planning research.  
* The site will be created following the principles of user experience design.
* The site will provide users links through to my social media accounts for additional content
* The site will provide users with a contact form, should they wish to contact me 
* The site will provide users with access to a gallery of my illustration work.
* The content of the site will be family-friendly and accessible to all.
* The site will be easy to navigate, intuitive with design consistency.

### Research

I conducted some research, looking at other aristic portfolios out there, examining their content, navigation and UI to ensure I could create a competitive online portfolio.

Sites included:
* [Sara Tepes Portfolio](https://www.sarucatepes.com/)
* [Anoosha Syed Portfolio](http://www.anooshasyed.com/)
* [Andrew Thomson Portfolio](https://athomson.art/)

Thoughts noted:
* Handwritten-style logos
* Nav bar at the top of the page
* Responsive design
* Similar user journey - Home - Gallery - Contact
* Same gallery grid for their portfolio
* They have contact forms
* Logos at the top left of the page
* White backgrounds to as to make the images the main focus
* Link to Patreon for users to support the artist

All of the above, I have reflecting in the design of my own website.

### Wireframes

I used Figma and Procreate to plan and design my wireframes and user journey. Figma has been really useful to use as a design board to hold all my inspiration and planning visually in one place. I initially designed the wireframe for my site on mobile first as planned, then proceeded to design desktop wireframes and plan out the user journey and navigation around the site.

### Color Scheme

As explained in my target audience research, I wanted to make sure that the colour used in the site was bright and feminine in aesthetic to appeal to a predominantly age 25-34, female audience, which incidentally is the demographic I fall into myself, so I felt it best conveyed my style and personality, which is always important to convey when showcasing any work based on my experience in the industry.
I went for a mix of warm and cool tones to ensure good colour readability contrast can always be achieved, which is important when considering the design of a site from an accessibility point of view.

### Typography

Running with the theme of adding personality to my site, as well as finding a typeface that didn't look too corporate alongside my handwritten logo, I went for a serif font to create a classic, nostalgic look. I will to ensure that font-size is large enough in mobile version to ensure good readability.

    I rigorously tested the site during the development phase using using the following:


<img src="#">

- __Testing the Home page__


- __Testing the Portfolio page__
  
  
- - __Testing the About Me page__


- __Validator Testing__

I ran all of the sites pages through the W3C validator and each page returned multiple errors.

I corrected the code and all four pages now return no html errors.

- The CSS stylesheet was passed through the Jigsaw Validator and returned no errors.

- __Performance Testing__

    

<br>

- __Other Bug Fixes__

  - On some touchscreen devices an error occurs due to the hover psuedo class which fails to deselect a nav link when a user returns to the previous page via the back arrow.

    <br>

    This bug was fixed by the inclusion of the "inactive" class selector and by setting the nav link elements to display=hidden on smaller screen sizes.
