## Planning & Development

- __Business Strategy__

     Recently, the band have moved away from the Irish cover-band circuit to performing their own songs, both as a support band for similar established acts and also as a headline act themselves in some of Ireland's smaller yet renowned indie venues.

     The band have since recieved multiple invitations to perform globally, and have recently conducted a small American tour which was extremely well recieved.

     Due to the growing popularity of the band, they now require an industry standard "Electronic Press Kit" to promote themselves and their exciting new direction.

     Focusing on user centered design, functionality, and exclusive media content, Cumasc Gael aims to provide its specified target audience with a positive and satisfying user experience.

- __Target Audience__

    Cumasc Gael are now aiming to share the same market space as similar acts within the indie/bluegrass genre.

    <img src="assets/readme_images/demographic_two.png">

    By collating information gleaned from the targeted Facebook ad campaigns of these groups I have determined the following:

  - Women account for approximately 60% of the band's target audience

  - 24-34 is the key age demographic of the target audience.

- __Targeting Key Demographics__

    The site's content and how it is displayed is informed by the outcomes of the research mentioned above. I have presented one example of this below.

    According to marketing website [socialtoaster.com](https://www.socialtoaster.com/marketing-to-a-female-demographic-6-tips/),
     women (as an audience) respond positively to social stories that are seen to champion a cause. Women are also interested in compelling news items.

     <img src="assets/readme_images/target_demo.png">

    In light of this data, (and because women make up the majority of the site's target audience) I have included a news section on the first page of the website featuring a positive social story, in which the band are clearly seen to be championing a worthy cause.

    <img src="assets/readme_images/target_news.png">

    Another way I have implemented this data is by featuring a youtube video on the Media (second) page of the site, which will appeal more to male members of the band's target audience as well the 24-34 key age demographic.

    The general artistic style of the site, (Traditional/Modern) including typograhy, color scheme and imagery also targets the key age demographic.

- __Wireframes__

    Desktop, tablet and mobile wireframes were created using Balsamiq software to give a general overview of the layout of the site and to help organise the content logically. An image is posted of one of the wireframes below. Links to each set of frames are also available.

   <img src="assets/readme_images/wireframe.png">

  - [Home page wireframes](assets/readme_images/wireframes/home_wf.pdf)

  - [Media page wireframes](assets/readme_images/wireframes/media_wf.pdf)

  - [About page wireframes](assets/readme_images/wireframes/about_wf.pdf)

  - [Contact page wireframes](assets/readme_images/wireframes/contact_wf.pdf)

    The site conforms to the general structure and scope of these wireframes yet deviates significantly with respect to the colour scheme.

- __Color Scheme__

  - The predominant feature of the color scheme is undoubtebtly greyscale.
    This is a stylistic choice and evoke's what the band calls its "Gilded Age" aesthetic. (The gilded age being an era before color photography and where traditional and bluegrass music were popular genres of music.)

  - The deep orange in the color scheme is referenced from the fire footer padding image and again is suggestive of a rustic and simpler epoch.  

  - The fire image was deliberatly included as flames and fire are also heavily featured in the band's upcoming music video for thier latest single.

  - The light orange colour was implemented to improve color contrast for increased accessibility during testing. This is referenced in the testing section of this document.

- __Typography__

- There are three fonts used throughout the site.

  - Quintessential: A cursive font to envoke the band's aesthetic is used for section headings.

  - Raleway: A popular sans serif font often utilised in modern music websites is used for section sub-headings.  

  - Helvetica: A clear, complimentary font often partnered with Raleway is used for all other text.

    The fonts were imported to the stylesheet via Google fonts.

# Testing

- __Testing During Development__

  - Testing Technologies

    <br>

    I rigorously tested the site during the development phase using using the following:


<img src="#">

- __Testing the Home page__


- __Testing the Portfolio page__
  
  
- - __Testing the About Me page__


- __Validator Testing__

I ran all of the sites pages through the W3C validator and each page returned multiple errors.

<img src="#">

I corrected the code and all four pages now return no html errors.

<img src="#">

- The CSS stylesheet was passed through the Jigsaw Validator and returned no errors.

- __Performance Testing__

    

<br>

- __Other Bug Fixes__

  - On some touchscreen devices an error occurs due to the hover psuedo class which fails to deselect a nav link when a user returns to the previous page via the back arrow.

    <br>

    This bug was fixed by the inclusion of the "inactive" class selector and by setting the nav link elements to display=hidden on smaller screen sizes.
