    I rigorously tested the site during the development phase using using the following:

- __Testing the Home page__


- __Testing the Portfolio page__
  
  
- - __Testing the About Me page__


- __Validator Testing__

I ran all of the sites pages through the W3C validator and each page returned multiple errors.

I corrected the code and all four pages now return no html errors.

- The CSS stylesheet was passed through the Jigsaw Validator and returned no errors.

- __Performance Testing__

    

<br>

- __Other Bug Fixes__

  - On some touchscreen devices an error occurs due to the hover psuedo class which fails to deselect a nav link when a user returns to the previous page via the back arrow.

    <br>

    This bug was fixed by the inclusion of the "inactive" class selector and by setting the nav link elements to display=hidden on smaller screen sizes.
